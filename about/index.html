Hi there!
<p>
Since I was a young kid I dreamed of changing the world and to contribute something meaningful to our reality. Many years ago I started to write my very first game. It was written in Delphi Pascal and had a horrible code base. I didn't know very much about software patterns, architecture and clean code.
</p><p>
Nowadays my games are larger, better and more fun to play. Every single day I try to improve on my skillset in order to create the next awesome game or website.
</p><p>
I love it mostly to work with the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
  <li><i class="fa fa-rocket" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> expert knowledge in Java, Software Architecture and Design Patterns</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-github-square" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> git and Github</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-linux" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> Linux (Ubuntu, Debian) and the command line</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-html5" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> web development (HTML5, Javascript, Typescript, CSS3, Vaadin)</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-bar-chart" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> client/server/network programming</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-desktop" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> 2D and 3D graphics and math</li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-gamepad" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> libGDX, Slick2D, Unity</li>
</ul>
