<h3>About</h3>

You are a wizard with a big castle. In your dungeon are creatures (your pets). They really don't like each other. Try to keep them all alive, by swiping their trails away. You can't control directly the monsters, that's tricky!

<h3>Theme</h3>

This year's theme was "We don't see things as they are. We see things as we are". In our game each creatue thinks that it's friendly, but all other ones are evil. Moreover it's hard to decide for which side you will be.
