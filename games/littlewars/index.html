<h3>About</h3>

Hundreds of robots want to conquer your planet. Defend your nation with strong soldiers, build factories and explore big maps.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>I love games like <a href="http://www.commandandconquer.com/de">Command&Conquer</a>, where you have all freedom to build a small base to have defense against other players. It's been a long time ago when I programmed this game. Therefore, many bugs (still) exist. The game has over 20.000 lines of code, excuse me for gameplay bugs!</p>
