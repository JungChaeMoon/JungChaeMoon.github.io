Hey everyone! I was pretty busy for many weeks. No game dev at all, sorry. Meanwhile I played other games and worked hard for school. This year was full of projects: [Galacticum](http://galacticum.my-reality.de), [AcidSnake](http://acidsnake.my-reality.de), [ShapeLoggers](http://shapeloggers.de) and [other stuff](http://brutal-dedication.de). In the following I'll cover all importants things in detail.

### Progress on Galacticum

My biggest game, called [Galacticum](http://galacticum.my-reality.de) is in development for many months. [A playable prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGOPboD2_CA) was released last year, but it was very minimalistic and contained only a rough idea, how the game should be in the end. 

This year (during summer vacation) I rewrote the whole game, because of wrong design decisions in the first try, including a core library change from [Slick2D](http://slick2d.org) to [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). Unfortunately I had not much time to finish version 0.1 this year. I'm currently studying software engineering and the actual semester was full of work. Hopefully I can continue this awesome game next year.

### Web design

My favorite part of computer science is Web design. I love it to produce high polished websites which are attractive and beautiful at the same time. My latest project is a website for a [Wildstar](http://www.wildstar-online.com/de/) gaming guild, called [Brutal Dedication](http://brutal-dedication.de).

I started on a design update for [ShapeLoggers](http://shapeloggers.de) last week. This update contains some polishing as well as improvements in the readability of some system parts.

### Game jams

Next year I want to be part of [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/jam-sites/global-game-jam-cologne) in cologne as well as [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com). This year were many interesting game jams out there. The most interesting one was [Mojam](http://minecraft-de.gamepedia.com/Mojam), a game jam event by [Mojang AB](https://mojang.com/). They streamed the whole event on Twitch, which was absolutely entertaining. I followed the event at school and at home. I recommend to watch it next time, you won't regret it!
