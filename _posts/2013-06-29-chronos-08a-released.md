title: Chronos 0.8alpha released
excerpt: Removed old stuff, added a bunch of interfaces, and something more.
---
The time has come! I proudly present you the newest version of my game development toolkit, [chronos 0.8alpha](http://chronos.my-reality.de). I was working on it over one month and the result is just amazing. The plan was to fix bugs but in the end I had to rewrite the whole code from scratch though.

I have redesigned and rewritten the following sections:

* Models
* Resources
* Scripting
* Utilities

### Brand new API

I removed old classes and wrote new interfaces instead. The new architecture is much better to maintain. Additionally I wrote basic implementation of each interface - it is on your own!

Furthermore I changed the javadoc version from 6 to 7 (not the JDK version of Java itself) to increase the readability of the documentation. You can find it [here](http://chronos.my-reality.de/javadoc/).

### From SVN to Git

Some of you may have noticed that I'm sending from my space station on planet [GitHub](https://github.com/MyRealityCoding). It is really fun to code something and being social at the same time. Git has (for me) many advantages and is much faster than Subversion. You can find a nice tutorial on the [official Git website](http://git-scm.com/documentation).
