I know some [german guys on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PixeltasticGame) who have founded a game team, called [Pixeltastic](http://pixeltastic.de). They worked hard on a game project and finally, the first version is out. The game is called [schMaus](http://pixeltastic.de/schMaus/) which is basically a 2D jump 'n run. In the following, I'll analyse some game mechanics here.

The game is still in development and may contain bugs. Therefore be aware of them and be mankind to the devs!

### Mechanics

You have to play a small mouse which jumps around. You have to be as fast as possible. Additionally you can collect points by shooting at things (like cheesy cheese). The controls are simpel: Move with the arrow keys, shoot with CTRL and jump with SPACE. 

That is a basic configuration, which shouldn't be that hard to learn. Nevertheless it was pretty hard to play the game completely for a simple reason. In fact there is no convenience given, when jumping around. At some point you have to wait in order to jump again. The jump and movement system should be improved later on.

### Setting

The setting is beautiful and authentic. All sprites have a detailed look and feel and the worlds (tiled maps, quite likely made with [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/)) are big enough to have a good time.

Some tiles are very repetitive. Therefore it doesn't look like a dynamic world, more like a tiled world. All in one it's a very good game setting.

### Story

You can watch the cinematic trailer here:

### Conclusion

The game is fun, indeed! I play it a lot. As mentioned before, the game is still under development! To play it, download the [Windows](http://pixeltastic.de/schMaus/schMaus_beta1_win.zip) version or the geeky [Linux](http://t.co/pGLMADEKWB) version.
