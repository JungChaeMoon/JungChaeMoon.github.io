title: Issues with Ubuntu again
excerpt: I use Ubuntu for a couple of years. Since I've upgraded to non-LTS versions, I experienced some issues.
---

At first I want to say that [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is the best thing I was ever able to met. Many hackers and nerds use other linux based systems (such as *Kubuntu*, *Debian* or *Fedora*), but I came always up with the simple and clean [12.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/) version of Ubuntu. 

For those who don't know, I'm using Linux because of:

* Full control over your system (**real** control)
* Quick navigation via terminal
* Security: Linux has high resistance against malware
* Speed! Loading things goes really fast
* I feel more geeky
* I am independent of companies (such as Microsoft)

There are many other things to put in the list, but it's not time to convince you due to use Ubuntu.

### Use Long Term Support (LTS) versions only

It might be awesome to use always newest features, provided by current versions of Ubuntu. Canonical releases frequently new updates (April and October updates). Unfortunately those updates come always with new features AND new bugs. For instance, you've set up a nice system with many applications, services and a special design. Suddenly after update to the latest version, nothing works and everything crashes. This happened to me yesterday and I moved back to the LTS version, because it's more stable and has a longer support.

### Never update manually

If you haven't much experience with Linux, kernels and upgrading software, please don't update Ubuntu in the terminal, which is pretty easy to do:

{% highlight text %}
do-release-upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

The temptation is high to configure something new or to push the wrong button, when a promp pops up.

### Customize wisely

The good thing about Ubuntu is the customization. It's possible to use a whole new user interface (e.g. [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/)), installing tools and tweaks. But choose wisely: some tools may slow down your system, which is, in fact very bad. I can recommend basic tools which improve the user experience a lot:

* [Ubuntu Tweak](http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Ubuntu_Tweak), a tool to customize your user interface and manipulating stuff
* [Moka Icon Theme](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/08/moka), a icon set of fancy rounded icons for your system

There is much more but those two should be enough for me.

### In the end

It's on your own which operating system to use, but as you can see it can be a lot of fun to have an indipendent system which actually does what you want. I'm currently pretty busy which preparing for exams and making games. Therefore I really don't need an operating system (such as Windows) which updates while watching a movie or doesn't allow you to control processes completely.
