title: Progress on 'Craft'
excerpt: I already spent a lot of time on technology, game design and art. Still there is a lot of work to do.
---
I did my last blog article a long time ago. Last year was pretty hard for me so I was unable to work on game projects at all. In a few months I'll definitely publish a first **playable** prototype of Craft, including a first profession, called the Jeweler.

# Current progress

The following things are implemented and ready to use:

* a first profession, called the Jeweler
* item logic: it is possible to learn multiple recipes by getting XP
* crafting view
* item listing
* inventory operations such as remove and add items
* drag and drop of items
* recipes
* command line interface (CLI) to modify the game at runtime
* sound effects
* animations

# Upcoming changes

To make the whole game experience more fun I decided to do fundamental changes:

* Quest NPCs which talk to you
* Particle effects everywhere
* non-complex crafting operations to keep fun up
* talent trees
* at least 100 items for the first profession

# Conclusion
