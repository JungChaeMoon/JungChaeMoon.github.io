title: Global Game Jam preperation
layout: post
excerpt: This year is my first Global Game Jam in Cologne. I need some preperation to get ready!
---
Well, 2014 has just started, full of work and fun. Each year (since 2008) thousands of 
people collaborate together in order to create games within 48 hours. That's not much but I wanna participate in order to improve my game development skills. Additionally I want to write 12 games this year (that's much, isn't it?) but it's completely doable. I have to prepare myself - physically as well as mentally.

### Catering

I need to get enough sleep during the 48 hour jam. Even if we have not enough time left, without sleep my brain just explodes. Moreover it is important for me to eat good stuff instead of "junk food". Furthermore drinking a lot is important as well. Normally I'm drinking around 3 litres a day!

### Java skills

I love Java and I love programming. To be productive as possible, I want to read more stuff about the tiled format in [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) as well as lighting and physics related topics. 

### If you want to join me

I'm currently very excited because I have no idea how the weekend will be. If you want to join me, [fill out the form on this site](http://colognegamelab.de/global-game-jam-2014/).
