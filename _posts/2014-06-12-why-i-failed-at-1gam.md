title: Why I failed at 1GAM
excerpt: 12 games in one year are possible. I made it only to 3. In this article I explain why.

In a recent article I wrote how motivated I was about to write 12 entire games this year. My motivation was high, I had nothing to loose and I saw it as a big challenge which could be done with discipline and fun.

### January game

In January I wrote my first #1GAM entry, called [Plox](/games/plox). I wrote it within 2 days by using Java in combination with LibGDX. It was fast to write because only swipe and shooting mechanics actually existed. At that point I really thought: "Well, writing games is very easy, this will be no problem for me!"

### February game

That month was something special. I collaborated with another guy (greetings to Manuel aka [API_Beast](http://twitter.com/API_Beast)), to write a game called **ShinyAvenger**. This game covered a big 2D space world full of enemies and tactics wher you have to flight around to kill stuff.

 It was fun to make not only because I could use C++ again. We used [Springbok](http://github.com/API-Beast/Springbok), a fancy C++ game library made by Manuel himself. We got far and released a first alpha version at the beginning of march. Besides, take a look at [Manuels work](http://api-beast.com), he's a true coding beast!

### March game

This month was easy for me, because we were forced to write a game at our university. The theme was "neon" so I decided to combine it with 1GAM. My classmate Jan and I wrote a game called "NeonWars", a 2D 4-in-a-row like game, completely written in C++.

### The disaster begins

A new theme (water) and new motivation. I moved back to my loved Java which I'm very used to. My idea was to create a game where you fight against villagers on the streets. After a few days I was able to set up a basic game with nice graphics and villagers. The game had to special things:

* everything was procedurally generated by the machine, no predefined textures
* own shaders for CRT effect and lighting (day/night cycle)

It looked something like this:

After 2 weeks I was able to play a simple easy game, but still no water. At this point I was pretty busy with other projects, such as [newtrients.de](http://newtrients.de), for which I created the whole webdesign with sass. Furthermore exams and personal problems. I don't want to get too much into detail. My life was stressful and I didn't found time to work on the project again. Then May went in, now it is June, still no game development.
It makes me sad that I can't write one single line of code at the moment for my beloved games. They mean everything to me, they're like little babies.

### What's now?

I can't handle depression as others can. Well, I'm not a guy which hates life or is pissed off all day. I love my life and enjoy many things. But when things get harder I simply stop with the things I love the most (like game development). I'm stuck and my head is flooded with new ideas. Maybe I try another month for 1GAM. Maybe not (for now). On August my internship begins at Codecentric and I'm pretty motivated, because I actually can write Java and use Git in a scrum team (yey!). Many devs would be jealous and I'm so excited to begin with my work.

Probably this break is good. Because breaks can lead to new ideas and more exciting ways of doing things. Well, focus should be on "doing" things and not "doing new things". To get stuff done is always a very rewarding feel. Game development is not only about writing a game. It's about the feedback, it's about Twitter (gamedev without twitter would suck) and it's about deadlines and (healthy pressure). Guys, don't get me wrong, I will continue game development. It's still my passion. But for now, I need a break. Good night.
