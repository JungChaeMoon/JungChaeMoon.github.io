title: RocketBeans Community Gamejam 2016
excerpt: An review on the past few days.

Maybe you have heard of the internet phenomenon [RocketBeans TV](http://rocketbeans.tv). It is a German Internet Television program which runs content 24/7. Basically they play games, have fun together and everything on screen. I am a big fan of their work and I am excited that they have even organized a 48 hour gamejam this weekend, the so called rbcgj or [RocketBeans Community Gamejam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/rbtvcgj).

## Finding a team

You can not start on a gamejam without a team. Well, I am not an aloner. Even when my technical strengths are spread I want to work with others to create something unique. I asked around for team mates and I found another guy called [Simon](https://twitter.com/_kostnix) who wanted to focus on audio and game design.

## When the jam started

The jam started on Friday, 6pm. We got together in Discord to talk via VoIP. The German theme was *Spuren von NÃ¼ssen* which means *Traces of nuts*. At first we have created a brainstorm diagram. Later on we played around with different themes and settings. One hour later we had a rough idea of the game itself.

## The Legend of Studentenfutter

Well, what should I say? This is the title. *Studentenfutter* is German and means nothing more than *a bag of nuts and raisins*. You play a small peanut called Eddy who wants to save his friends because they got taken by an evil squirrel. It is up to you to decide their future.

## Little sleep. Much work.

We estimated three three iterations for the gamejam:

1. Milestone 1: Core mechanics
2. Milestone 2: Story system
3. Milestone 3: Mob and battle system

Unfortunately we could not manage to start with the third milestone due to lack of available time. However we created three levels with a lot of content and features like:

* NPC interaction
* Item system
* Teleporters
* Caves
* Bridges

## Retrospective

After those 48 hours I was completely destroyed but I still loved it. Creating something huge in very little time causes suffering and hapiness at the same time. I would definitely do it again!
