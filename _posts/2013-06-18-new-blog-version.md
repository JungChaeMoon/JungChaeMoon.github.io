Hey guys! Welcome to a new blog version, built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). My old blog has been built with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) but it was extremly slow on my virtual server. Therefore I’d decided to enter a new world full of beauty.

### Not much time

I’m pretty busy at the moment (exams, exams). As a result I haven’t much time for coding and projects. It took me much time to create this new blog because I’d to read a lot of stuff about how to configure a working Git repository on my server.

### Git is fun

The big advantage of my new setting is that it’s pretty secure! Everything is generated and all content is provided by static pages. Sounds like magic but it works for me. To create a new post I’ve to write a new markdown file locally and after comitting a hook script will do the rest.

I want to create a more detailed tutorial in the next weeks. Be prepared and stay tuned. Cheers.
